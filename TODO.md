# Experiments to run

## Informativity of labels

Standard recalibration paradigm with the pragmatic labels.

[possible] manipulate informativity of labels systematically: more or less ambig labeled trials.

## Prior constraints on adaptation

Run lots of different distributions.

# Models

## Sensitivity to variance

Predicted effect sizes with different degrees of variance

...with additional sensory uncertainty.

## Hierarchical belief udpating

Generalization across talkers.

Learning new cluster of talkers.

## Informativity of labels

Quantify how informative labels are with belief updating model (or just using prior beliefs + suprisal).

# Reading/lit review

## Supervised + unsupervised category learning

What do people think is the difference behaviorally?  What kind of labels are typically used?  Has been studied with pre-existing categories?

## Sensory adaptation

"Smart" adaptation literature (follow up leads from Stocker and Sharpee among others).

## Learning across contexts

Ting's papers, references therein.
