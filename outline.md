# Introduction: perception in an uncertain and nonstationary world

## The general problem, and an outline of a solution

## Speech as a model organism: the ideal adapter framework

* Introduction of ideal adapter paper
* some or all of the theory/modeling outline from Part I

# Belief updating, recalibration, and selective adaptation

## Recalibration

* section from ideal adapter paper

## Selective adaptation

* section from ideal adapter paper.
* __could merge with last subsection__

## Never the 'twain shall meet?

* section from ideal adapter paper: intermediate conditions

# The role of variability

* What role does variability play in speech perception?
* Set up with stuff from Part III of the ideal adapter paper
    * abstractionist/episodic debate
    * subphonetic variability
* Section that was cut from the selective adaptation paper on "why track variance" (cue reliability)

## Recalibration: shift or relaxation?

* section from ideal adapter paper

## Real and perceived variability

* studies on high-variance adaptation/recalibration
    * Vroomen paradigm (CUNY2012 poster)
    * Arty selective adaptation paradigm
    * maybe Clayards et al., 2008.
* simulations to make point that it's _hard_ to detect effect of variance using these paradigms.
* possibly modeling of sensory uncertainty + belief updating

# Talkers and types of talkers: beyond belief updating

* Part II of the ideal adapter paper, more or less

## Talker-specificity

* sections from ideal adapter paper, Part II

## Generalization across talkers

* sections from ideal adapter paper, Part II

## Hierarchical belief updating: a model

* modeling of generalization experiments by itself here after basic theoretical discussion.  Or could be folded into the above sections as appropriate

# Acquisition in the face of nonstationarity

* __Maybe__
* bit on acquisition from ideal adapter part III.
* ideally, will include new modeling and data on cross-talker variability from vowels.

# Sensation, perception, and adaptation

## Sensory adaptation, dumb and smart

* the position paper on selective adaptation, or the first part, 
* possibly expanded with more references and theoretical discussion about how/whether it's possible to distinguish fatigue and "smart" adaptation

## Speech perception as a model organism: selective adaptation

* the specifically speech parts of selective adaptation paper
* (possibly) modeling of reaction time effects etc.

# How does the brain allocate neural resources across tasks and contexts?

* Or, speech as a model organism :)  (for studying the intersection of efficient coding + adaptation)

## Efficient coding of speech sounds

* Basic proof-of-concept: within-category distinctions get less neural resource than between-category distinctions
* Reanalysis of Blumestein, Myers, and Rissman (2005).

## Adaptation and the coding of speech sounds

* This efficient allocation is (I hope) _flexible_
* Imaging study on adaptation/distributional learning that's currently in piloting

## How robust are the representations of speech sounds to changes in talkers

* Does efficient allocation reflect just tracking local statistics or inference about appropriate generative model?
* Talker switching/adaptation studies.  Contingent on the last section working out, obviously.

## Something something optimizing representations for the task

* More evidence that learning results in changes in coding/allocation of resources.
* Animals study.  Representations change after you learn task.
