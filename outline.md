# Introduction: perception in an uncertain and nonstationary world

## The general problem, and an outline of a solution

## Speech as a model organism: the ideal adapter framework

(Introduction of ideal adapter paper plus some or all of the theory/modeling outline from Part I)

# Belief updating, recalibration, and selective adaptation

## Recalibration

(section from ideal adapter paper)

## Selective adaptation

(section from ideal adapter paper)

## Never the 'twain shall meet?

(section from ideal adapter paper: intermediate conditions)

# The role of variability

What role does variability play in speech perception?  A mix of stuff from Part III of the ideal adapter paper (stuff on abstractionist/episodic debate, subphonetic variability)

## Recalibration: shift or relaxation?

(section from ideal adapter paper)

## Real and perceived variability

* studies on high-variance adaptation/recalibration
    * Vroomen paradigm (CUNY2012 poster)
    * Arty selective adaptation paradigm
    * maybe Clayards et al., 2008.
* simulations to make point that it's _hard_ to detect effect of variance using these paradigms.
* possibly modeling of sensory uncertainty + belief updating

# Talkers and types of talkers: beyond belief updating

(Part II of the ideal adapter paper, more or less)

## Talker-specificity

## Generalization across talkers

## Hierarchical belief updating: a model

(modeling by itself here after basic theoretical discussion.  Or could be folded into the above sections as appropriate)

# Acquisition in the face of nonstationarity

* bit on acquisition from ideal adapter part III.
* ideally, will include new modeling and data on cross-talker variability from vowels.

# Sensation, perception, and adaptation

## Sensory adaptation, dumb and smart

(basically the position paper on selective adaptation, or the first part, possibly expanded)

## Speech perception as a model organism: selective adaptation

* the phonetic selective adaptation parts of that paper, specifically
* (possibly) modeling of reaction time effects.

# How does the brain allocate neural resources across tasks and contexts?

## Efficient coding of speech sounds

* Reanalysis of Blumestein, Myers, and Rissman (2005).

## Adaptation and the coding of speech sounds

* Study on adaptation/distributional learning

## How robust are the representations of speech sounds to changes in talkers

* Talker switching/adaptation studies.  Contingent on the last section working out, obviously.



## Something something optimizing representations for the task

* Animals study.  Representations change after you learn task.
