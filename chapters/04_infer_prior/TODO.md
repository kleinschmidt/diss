* expt1 results
    * [done] boundary analysis figure (now in table). base on svalp slides
* clean up experiment 2 results
    * [done] get rid of lmer models
    * [done] nice boundary figures (violing from svalp)
    * [done] goodness of fit a la expt1
* intro:
    * [done] expand background (more detail on studies showing constraints)
    * [could] tie in with distributional learning
    * [done] two experiments now
    * [could] "what is a typical talker". more variable estimates for /b/ across sources, including prevoicing.. variabiltiy _across talkers_ too.
* expt 1
    * [done; didn't need anything really] this is now expt 1, revise accordingly
* modeling
    * [done] goldrick prevoiced VOT data (incorporate into beliefs plot)
    * [done] compare inferred beliefs with actual cross talker variability from corpora
        * analysis
        * [done] bullets
        * write
    * [could] fit model to exp2?
* expt2
    * [done] intro (why)
