* expt1 results
    * [done] boundary analysis figure (now in table). base on svalp slides
* clean up experiment 2 results
    * [done] get rid of lmer models
    * [done] nice boundary figures (violing from svalp)
    * goodness of fit a la expt1
* intro:
    * expand background (more detail on studies showing constraints)
    * [could] tie in with distributional learning
    * [done] two experiments now
* expt 1
    * [done; didn't need anything really] this is now expt 1, revise accordingly
* expt2
    * intro (why)
        * [done] bullets
        * write
    * [done] methods/participants
    * write results
* discussion
    * incorporate cog sci discussion??
    * other sources of constraints (self-production, innate auditory)
