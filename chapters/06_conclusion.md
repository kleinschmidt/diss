# Conclusion

* what have I done.
    * theoretical/computational framework for understanding variability in speech perception
    * computational model of rapid adaptation via belief updating. applied to
        * recalibration
        * selective adaptation
        * distributional learning
    * computational tools for reasoning about structure in talker variation.
        * evaluated how informative socio-indexical variables are for cue distributions, and how useful for speech recognition and socio-indexical judgements
* who cares
