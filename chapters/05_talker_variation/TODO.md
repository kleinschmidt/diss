* abstract
* editing
    * terminology
        * sex -> gender? (would require renaming results, or in data and then re-running)
        * variation/variability
    * framing: 
        * just variation in speech? or two traditions more broadly. at least clarify that variability is a big thing and its treated differently
        * can strengthen contrast between two
        * ref for socio traditon (Eckert, Labov)
        * at end of intro, state v. clearly what goals are. explicit question and why we think it's important. relate to language in call for proposals
    * background
        * move background section down until after we've gotten to our goals
        * move footnote into text? relevant for our study
        * unpack (see comments in PDF)
            * generalization/recalibration sentence
    * in goals:
        * spell out "both are inference" (second goal)
        * set up goals and approach at a higher, conceptual level. current it's implicit ("incrementally reveals itself")
        * caveat about social categories (dynamically constructed, not static). limitation of convenience/availability of corpora
    * add anticipatory structure
    * methods:
        * unpack methods.
            * classifier
            * KL (maybe graph)
        * add some section structure (to separate conceptual and practical aspects)
    * results
        * informativity: reframe. 
            * don't expect big differences for VOT, and we don't find any.
            * expect finer grained -> more informative
            * one reason, vowels vary across teh board by talker, but in more specific ways for dialect.
            * thus: look at single-vowel effects. find interesting patterns across dialect/vowel combinations
            * THEN: what does normalization do? eliminates some of the global effects of sex. doesn't decrease informativity of dialect. but sex still matters, in combination w/ dialect.
        * lol sex is not most informative actually
