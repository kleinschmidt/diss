* [done] clean up results
    * [done] gentler introduction in each results section
    * [done] get rid of joint inference (or put in appendix or something. the result that accuracy goes up but posterior probability goes down is pretty puzzling and probably hard to explain)
    * [check figures. (esp captions and axes labels)
        * normalized formant frequencies in dist plots figure...
        * aspect ratio for vowel-specific KL?
    * [done] what about results for bilinguals? footnote or something at least...
    * [done] clean up figure seven (dialect advantage) and add caption
* finish discussion
    * summary of results and big take away points to start (base on introduction)
    * check commented bits in "what to track" subsection
    * I have a feeling the "what to track" point is going to be hard to understand. maybe a gentler intro to that will help. start with something like "lots of ways to think about what's informative"
    * why even bother using KL? "common currency". maybe discussion not best place to make this point but it's important
    * connect back to computational-level, maybe in talking about lower bound. lower bound on an upper bound :)
    * how to tie back in with soclx?
        * generate hypotheses about relative contributions of different acoustic-phonetic cues for social variables based on lots of production data.
        * raises questions about how people deal with _uncertainty_ in their socio-linguistic inferences.
    * normalization vs. adaptation (what should be learned depends a lot on whether input is normalized)
* conclusion + abstract
* editing
    * sex -> gender? (would require renaming results, or in data and then re-running)
