  This thesis was supervised by a committee of Professors T. Florian Jaeger
  (advisor) and Richard Aslin of the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences,
  and Professor Lori Holt of the Department of Psychology at Carnegie Melon
  University. I am the primary author of the text of this dissertation. The work
  reported herein was completed in close collaboration with Florian
  Jaeger. Chapter~\ref{chap:ideal-adapter} was published as
  \textcite{Kleinschmidt2015}, and Chapter~\ref{chap:selective-adaptation} was
  published as \textcite{Kleinschmidt2015b}. Experiment 1 and the modeling work
  reported in Chapter~\ref{chap:infer-priors} overlaps substantially with
  \textcite{Kleinschmidt2016}.

  This research was supported by a Sproull Fellowship from the University of
  Rochester, an NSF GRFP (starting in 2011), and an NRSA F-31 grant from the
  National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD; starting in 2015)
