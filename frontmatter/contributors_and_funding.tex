  This thesis was supervised by a committee of Professors T. Florian Jaeger,
  Richard Aslin, Lori Holt, and Jeffrey Runner. I am the primary author of the
  text of this dissertation. The work reported herein was completed in close
  collaboration with Florian Jaeger. Chapter~\ref{chap:ideal-adapter} was
  published as \textcite{Kleinschmidt2015}, and
  Chapter~\ref{chap:selective-adaptation} was published as
  \textcite{Kleinschmidt2015b}. Experiment 1 and the modeling work reported in
  Chapter~\ref{chap:infer-priors} overlaps substantially with
  \textcite{Kleinschmidt2016}.
